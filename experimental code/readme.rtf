\f0\b\fs24 \cf0 Lab Experiments:
\b0 \
\
To run the experiments:\
The experimental codes for Exp1 and Exp4 run locally. To run the experiment, simply start from ExpX (lab)/templates/instructions/instruction1.html. It will go through the instructions, comprehension tests and the task (180 trials), followed by a post-task question on strategy.\
\
To get the data:\
The responses to the comprehension tests are automatically printed on the screen above the \'93Back\'94 button after the participant\'92s responses. See variable \'93trialdata\'94 in quiz1.js and quiz2.js for the meaning of the numbers.\
After the participant completes the entire task, they will see a page starting with "Thanks for participating in the experiment!\'94. Press the \'93`\'94 key and all the data for the task and the strategy question will be printed on the screen. The data is printed as an array in the sequence of the 180 trials (in total 1350 responses). Each response consists of 6 numbers (trial number, total number of days, current day, reaction time, choice - 1 for exploration and 0 for exploitation, reward). The array is followed by the answer to the strategy question.\

\b Mturk Experiments:
\b0 \
\
To run the experiments:\
The Mturk experiments (Exp2, 3 and 5) are programmed with psiTurk ({\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://psiturk.org/"}}{\fldrslt https://psiturk.org/}}) to run on Mturk. Please kindly refer to psiTurk documentation ({\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://psiturk.org/docs/"}}{\fldrslt https://psiturk.org/docs/}}) to see how to run the experiments both locally and on Mturk.\
\
To get the data:\
The data are recorded in the same format as lab experiments, but in a local database file called participants.db.}
