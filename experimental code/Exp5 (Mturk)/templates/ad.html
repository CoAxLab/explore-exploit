<!-- 
	The ad.html has a very specific format.

	Really there are two "ads" contained within this file.

	The first ad displays to participants who are browsing
	the Amazon Mechanical Turk site but have not yet accepted
	your hit.  

	The second part of the ad display after the person selected
	"Accept HIT" on the Amazon website.  This will reload the
	ad and will display a button which, when clicked, will pop
	open a new browser window pointed at your local psiTurk
	server (assuming it is running and accessible to the Internet).

	See comments throughout for hints

                    <p>
                        Professor Wei Ji Ma and his team in the Department of Psychology at New York University invite you to participate in a brief experiment. The purpose of this research is to understand how people make decisions under uncertainty. You will be asked to use information presented on the screen to make simple decisions. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The task will take about 15 minutes, and you will receive $1.00 if you complete the task, with the possibility to earn a bonus of up to $4.00. You will not be paid unless you complete the task. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You must be 18 years or older to participate. By clicking “ACCEPT” below, you indicate agreement to participate in this study, and declare that you are 18 years or older.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After the initial instructions, you may be asked to confirm your understanding of these instructions through some simple questions. If so, <b>you will be able to continue the task only when you answer these questions correctly</b>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Taking part in this study is voluntary and you may withdraw at any time. There are no known risks associated with your participation in this research beyond those of everyday life. Although you will receive no direct benefits, this research may help us understand how people make decisions. Your participation will be anonymous: we will never know your identity or personal details.
